data and scripts exampling stosim modeling

 

Latest recovery of old work adds new functions to stosim. This is preliminary to
release on both R-Forge and ultmately CRAN. A co2capture.r script is provided as
a function co2capture(). This will run the original analysis on a moderately
complex co2capture system. The goal of analysis was to determine first the
production weighted availability of CO2 recovery and then the times at various
operating status conditions as a percentage of all time.

Windows users can load the stosim version 0.0.15 from this repository. The
binary is in the stosim_0.0.15.zip file. Do not unzip this in Windows as you
might expect. Rather store this in a local file system and use the “Install
package(s) from local files . . .” option available under the packages menu in
the R Console or similar command available in RStudio.
